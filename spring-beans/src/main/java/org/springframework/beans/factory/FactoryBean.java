/**
 * 通过FactoryBean可以不遵循Bean的生命周期，可以自定义Bean的创建过程，我们实现FactoryBean接口的类必须通过xml配置文件或者@Bean注解让spring容器扫描到才能生效。
 * 通过FactoryBean的getObject方法获取的bean不会放入spring容器的三级缓存中。而是单独在beanFactory的factoryBeanObjectCache中缓存。spring会缓存我们实现FactoryBean接口的类的实例生成的bean。
 *
 * 1，FactoryBean可以用于创建那些具有复杂初始化逻辑或依赖关系的Bean对象。它可以通过自定义的逻辑来创建和配置Bean，例如在创建Bean之前执行某些操作、动态地根据条件选择实例化的对象等。<br>
 *
 * 2,当需要将第三方库的对象纳入到Spring容器中进行管理时，可以使用FactoryBean来创建和管理这些对象。通过FactoryBean，可以将第三方库的对象实例化和配置的过程与Spring的生命周期管理进行集成。<br>
 *
 * 3,有些Bean对象可能在应用程序启动时不需要立即创建，而是在需要时才进行实例化。FactoryBean可以支持延迟初始化，只有在调用getObject()方法时才会实际创建Bean对象，从而提高应用程序的性能和资源利用率。<br>
 *
 * 4,FactoryBean可以用于创建代理对象，例如AOP（面向切面编程）中的代理对象。通过自定义的FactoryBean，可以在创建Bean对象时添加代理逻辑，实现对目标对象的增强或拦截。<br>
 *
 * 5,FactoryBean可以根据条件来创建Bean对象，根据不同的条件返回不同的实例。这在某些场景下非常有用，例如根据配置文件或运行时的环境参数来决定创建哪个具体的Bean实例。<
 *
 *
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in the
 * bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access to
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 *
 * <p><b>The container is only responsible for managing the lifecycle of the FactoryBean
 * instance, not the lifecycle of the objects created by the FactoryBean.</b> Therefore,
 * a destroy method on an exposed bean object (such as {@link java.io.Closeable#close()}
 * will <i>not</i> be called automatically. Instead, a FactoryBean should implement
 * {@link DisposableBean} and delegate any such close call to the underlying object.
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
